## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-java.git
    cd design-patterns-java
    ```

2. **Run the examples**:
    Each pattern has a dedicated folder with an example of its implementation. You can run each pattern example by navigating to the respective directory and running the Java files. Here's an example for the Singleton pattern:
    
    ```bash
    cd src/creational/singleton
    javac SingletonExample.java
    java SingletonExample
    ```

## ðŸ“š About Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like templates that you can use to solve problems in different situations. This repository provides examples of three main types of design patterns:

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition or the organization of classes and objects to form larger structures.

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, and how objects interact and communicate with each other.

## ðŸ¤– How to Use This Repository

You can use this repository to:

- **Learn**: Each pattern is implemented with simple examples to make learning easier.
- **Experiment**: Modify the examples and try to implement your own variations of the design patterns.
- **Reference**: Use it as a reference guide for your projects that require certain design patterns.
